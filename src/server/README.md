Note:
 - When building on the RPi, `npm install` may fail. This is because of the variant of Node.js that comes preinstalled with Raspbian causing native addons to Node.js not to build. There's a workaround that can be found [here.](https://github.com/fivdi/onoff/wiki/Node.js-v0.10.29-and-native-addons-on-the-Raspberry-Pi)


To do:
 - make sure requires are working properly
 - update packages.json to run correctly
